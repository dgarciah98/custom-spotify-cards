# Custom Spotify Card Generator

A Rust + WASM Yew app that generates a custom card image of your favorite song from Spotify.

This is based on the same implementation I did for a Telegram bot, which can be found here [https://github.com/dgarciah98/spotify_uri_bot/tree/image-generation](https://github.com/dgarciah98/spotify_uri_bot/tree/image-generation)

## TODO

- [x] Deploy to Github Pages
- [ ] Add options to generate an image with plain color background (or inverted gradient)
- [ ] Add some examples to the readme
- [ ] Definitely make the webpage less ugly
- [ ] Add more details to the readme
- [ ] Add explanations on how to run and set up the project
- [ ] Maybe upload a backend version???
